          Project Title: Internet Censorship Lab (ICLab) <br>
          Principal Investigators: Prof. Ronald J. Deibert (Munk School of Global Affairs, University of
          Toronto), Prof. Phillipa Gill (Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA) <br>
          Sponsor: National Science Foundation (USA) <br>
          You are being asked to be a volunteer in a research study that seeks to characterize worldwide
          deployments of Internet censorship technology. This phase of the project is a pilot to test our
          censorship detection platform and receive feedback to improve the system. This research project
          is led by researchers at University of Toronto and Stony Brook University.

          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading termsHeading">PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY</h4>

          <p class="list-group-item-text">
          The purpose of this study is: To document and analyze the practice of national-level Internet
          censorship through the creation of a global network of researchers running censorship
          measurement software.
          </p>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
          This measurement software will run tests from your computer or dedicated hardware device
          which attempt to access a list of sensitive URLs. These sensitive URLs include political, social
          and religious content, and can include such material as oppositional political content,
          pornography and content critical of religion. The software will collect data from these tests and
          send it back to servers hosted at the University of Toronto which are maintained by the
          researchers. This data will be used to determine what content is being censored, what technical
          methods are used for censorship and how censorship changes over time. This is a pilot phase of
          the project that is intended to test the measurement software and collect user feedback that can be
          used to improve the system and research protocol.

          <p class="list-group-item-text">
          If you decide to be in this study, you will help run network measurement experiment software
          from network locations you have access to. You will be asked to run the software from either a
          dedicated hardware device that the researchers will supply to you or from your personal
          computer.</p>

              interaction.</p>

          <p class="list-group-item-text"></p>

          <p class="list-group-item-text">
          Throughout the 12 month duration of the project you will receive analysis reports of the
          measurement experiments you have participated in. These reports may help you gain a better
          understanding of the prevalence, depth, and breadth of Internet filtering in your country.
          </p>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
          There are no other direct benefits from participation in this research study, although your
          participation may help contribute to the public good by educating society about the prevalence,
          depth, and breadth of Internet filtering around the world.

        <div class="list-group-item">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading termsHeading">SECURITY and CONFIDENTIALITY</h4>

          <p class="list-group-item-text">
          Every effort will be made to maintain the strictest confidentiality. Data will only be used for the
          purposes outlined in the information and consent forms. Only members of the research team will
          have access to personally identifiable data. No information about research participants, or
          provided by research participants during the research, will be disclosed to others without the
          participants’ prior formal written consent.
          </p>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
          Electronic data will be stored in a secure server environment maintained at the University of
          Toronto. Any personally identifiable data kept on computers outside of this secure server
          environment will be encrypted at all times using strong encryption (128 bit AES) except to the
          extent researchers need to decrypt them during use.
          </p>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
          Experiment data may include issuing requests for URLs found in the URL list (similar to what a
          user does manually with a Web browser, such as Firefox, but automated), DNS queries (mapping
          hostnames such as Google.com to IP address such as 72.14.52.3), or traceroutes (measuring
          network paths). Experiments may log network traffic associated with the experiment (e.g.,network packets and timestamps). The software will also contain a unique user ID to allow us to
          map users back to their informed consent and identify faulty installation.
          </p>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
          Once an experiment has completed the resulting data will be sent, along with the experiment ID
          and user ID to the data management system. Once the data management system confirms receipt
          of the data it will be removed from the client software. Personally identifiable data that will be
          collected and transmitted will be your IP address. Experiment results will be encrypted to ensure
          they are not observable in transit and this personally identifiable data (as well as the unique user
          ID) will only be accessible to researchers at the University of Toronto.
          </p>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">
          Whenever the client communicates with the experiment controller or the data management
          system the data will be encrypted and may also be sent to a proxy (e.g., in Amazon EC2 data
          centers) before being forwarded on to the target system. The proxy will not store the data and
          will not contain the key required to decrypt any data it forwards.

          The following risks may occur as a result of you being in this study:

          <div class="list-group">
            <div class="list-group-item">
              <p>Your ISP or network administrator may be able to see the list of websites being accessed
              by the measurement software if they are monitoring the network. There is a risk that
              accessing such websites and running these tests violates network policies.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="list-group-item-text">
          The potential risks posed by conducted these tests is highly specific to the context in which the
          tests take place. These risks are highly dependent on the domestic political and legal context in
          your country. While it is challenging to definitively identify what the risks of conducting these
          tests may be in your country, we have compiled a number of metrics to help inform you of the
          potential risks in your country.
